        <h3>INTRO</h3>
        <div>
            <p>My name is Mackenzie, and I am currently enrolled at Simon Fraser University (SFU). I'm in my fourth year, majoring in Interactive Arts and Technology.</p>
            <p>When I'm not consuming art, I'm making it. Currently I'm picking up programming interactive pieces in programs like TouchDesigner, but my roots are in more traditional mediums. Acrylics on canvas is my go-to for visual art. </p>

        <h3>Education</h3>
        <div>
            <p>At SFU, the School of Interactive Art and Technology provides oppurtunities for self-directed projects. Each course has a final project where students pick their own direction among criteria. Moreso, the school offers directed studies where students choose the direction of the whole course and its criteria.

        <h3>Experience</h3>
        <div>
            <p>My most fullfilling project experience comes from one of these self-directed coursed SFU offeres. Under the guidence of Susan Clements-Vivian I took the lower division directed study where I pitched and built a proof of concept for an interactive video installation. At the end of the course I held an exhibition for version 1 of the project at the SFU Surrey campus</p>
            <p>Now, I'm in IAT 443: Senior Project in Creative Media. Using my proof of concept, I'm reinstallting an updated version 2 of the project to hold an exhibition across all three SFU campuses: Burnaby, Vancouver, and Surrey.
